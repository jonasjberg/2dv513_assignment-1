\section{Task 1 --- MoviesDB}
Based on an exercise from Fundamentals of Database Systems\cite{2dv513:fds}.

I have used the 7th edition which differs slightly from the 5th edition.
The relevant diagram is included in Figure~\ref{fig:fds_3-25} for reference.

\subsection{Problem Description}
The problem description \cite{2dv513:assignment1-instructions} is stated as
follows:

\begin{quote}
  Assume that MoviesDB is a populated database.

	Given the constraints shown in the E/R diagram,
	respond to the following statements with True, False, or Maybe.

	Assign a response of Maybe to statements that, although not explicitly
  shown to be True, cannot be proven False based on the schema as shown.

  Justify each answer.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      There are no actors in this database that have been in no movies.
    \item
      There are some actors who have acted in more than ten movies.
    \item
      Some actors have done a lead role in multiple movies.
    \item
      A movie can have only a maximum of two lead actors.
    \item
      Every director has been an actor in some movie.
    \item
      No producer has ever been an actor.
    \item
      A producer cannot be an actor in some other movie.
    \item
      There are movies with more than a dozen actors.
    \item
      Some producers have been a director as well.
    \item
      Most movies have one director and one producer.
    \item
      Some movies have one director but several producers.
    \item
      There are some actors who have done a lead role, directed a movie,
      and produced a movie.
    \item
      No movie has a director who also acted in that movie.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{quote}


\subsection{Solutions}

\subsubsection{1 --- There are no actors in this database that have been in no movies}
False. Double lines between \texttt{ACTOR} and \texttt{PERFORMS\_IN} describe a
total participation of \texttt{ACTOR} in the \texttt{PERFORMS\_IN} relationship
to the \texttt{MOVIE} entity.
This essentially means that individuals that have been an actor is considered an actor.
