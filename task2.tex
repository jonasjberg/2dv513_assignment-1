\section{Task 2}
Based on an exercise from \emph{Database Systems -- The Complete Book}
\cite{2dv513:dbs}, sections 2.2.6 and 2.2.7.

\subsection{Problem Description}
The problem description \cite{2dv513:assignment1-instructions} is stated as
follows:

\begin{quote}
  Consider a model where an entity set Births is related to Babies, Mothers,
  Doctors, and Nurses by four binary relationships.

  How can you use multiplicity to represent the following conditions?

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      Every baby is the result of a unique birth, and every birth is of a
      unique baby.
    \item
      In addition to (1), every baby has a unique mother.
    \item
      In addition to (1) and (2), for every birth there is a unique doctor.
  \end{enumerate}

  In each case, what design flaws do you see?

  Suppose we change our viewpoint to allow a birth to involve more than one
  baby born to one mother.
  How would you represent the fact that every baby still has a unique mother?
\end{quote}


\subsection{Solutions}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      % Every baby is the result of a unique birth, and every birth is of a
      % unique baby.

    \item
      % In addition to (1) and (2), for every birth there is a unique doctor.
